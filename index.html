		<div class="question">
			<h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h2>
			<p>I really got the most out of the lectures and powerpoint presentations. I prefer to have core concepts delivered in bite size pieces and the lectures, slides, and lecture activities really did more to move me along. </p>

		<div class="question">
			<h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
			<p>I wouldn't change anything. I personally like the format.</p>

		<div class="question">
			<h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
			<p>Somewhat. I feel I would have learned more if I could have kept pace with the assignments but that is solely on me and not indicative of the quality of the class. I plan on keeping in lock step next semester.</p>

		<div class="question">
			<h2>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h2>
			<p>CSS Grid and bootstrap were new to me. The other concepts I had more exposure to like colors and typography.</p>
